<h1>Day 19 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 19 challenge, I created a Turtle Racing game that allows users to guess the fastest turtle. This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object-oriented Programming - allowing for "key" input, usage of multiple instances and modification of states</li>
  <li>conditional statements - while and if</li>
  <li>Turtle class exploration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>

<h2>You can join me too!</h2>
